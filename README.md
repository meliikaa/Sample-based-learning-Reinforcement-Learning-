# Reinforcement Learning Projects

Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning Projects repository! This collection of projects explores various aspects of reinforcement learning, focusing on different algorithms and environments. Each project addresses specific learning objectives and provides practical insights into reinforcement learning concepts. Below, you'll find an overview of each project:

## Project 1: Policy Evaluation in Cliff Walking Environment
In this project, we dive into the fundamentals of sample and bootstrapping-based model-free reinforcement learning agents for prediction. Specifically, we implement an agent that employs one-step temporal difference learning, also known as TD(0). The task at hand is policy evaluation in the Cliff Walking environment. Key learning objectives include:

- Implementing parts of the Cliff Walking environment to specify Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
- Creating an agent using bootstrapping techniques, particularly TD(0).
- Applying TD(0) to estimate value functions for different policies, running policy evaluation experiments.


## Project 2: Q-Learning and Expected Sarsa
In this assignment, we implement Q-Learning with ùúñ-greedy action selection and Expected Sarsa with ùúñ-greedy action selection. We investigate the behavior of these two algorithms in the context of the Cliff World environment. Key tasks include:

- Implementing Q-Learning and Expected Sarsa algorithms.
- Exploring how these algorithms perform in the Cliff World environment, which poses episodic challenges with cliffs and rewards.

## Project 3: Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+
This project introduces Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+ algorithms, emphasizing their performance in an evolving environment. Key objectives of this assignment include:

- Implementing the Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+ algorithms.
- Comparing their performance in an environment that becomes 'better' over time, presenting the task as a discounted, episodic challenge.
